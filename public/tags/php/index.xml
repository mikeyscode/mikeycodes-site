      <description>Your IDE Is Not an Excuse for Unreadable Code &amp;nbsp;
I was reviewing some pull requests recently and I got into a little debate. Just before I go into what that was exactly let me prefix this with: as a developer I am a very strong believer in writing clean, readable code. From top to bottom it should read like a story and if I handed it to someone who had never coded in their life, I want them to be able to understand roughly what the code is doing.</description>

If you are wondering why that’s different to how it normally works, think of it this way:
We have a bridge, on one side of the bridge is all the commands we want to run. Our helper memorises a single command, carries it across the bridge and executes it.</description>
