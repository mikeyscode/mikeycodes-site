One of the best habits I have is how frequently I set goals and achieve them. It’s a cycle that I am constantly harping on about to anyone that will listen. That does also mean I’m also the annoying person who asks how your new year resolutions are going halfway through the year (Sorry). This goal setting mentality initially grew while working at UKFast and listening to a lot of the insights that Lawrence Jones (the CEO) had to share in Monday briefings. He has countless blog posts, podcasts and writings on goals and goal setting. If you aren’t aware of him I would definitely look into him and here’s one of the podcasts to get you started; [My number one tip to smash your goals and achieve greatness](https://www.lawrencejones.co.uk/podcasts/2018/09/03/my-number-on-tip-to-smash-your-goals-and-achieve-greatness/)

But back to the topic at hand, what are ‘SMART’ goals and how do we set them? First of all, SMART stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Timely. There are a few variations but the general premise is the same. So let's break each of them down.

# Specific
What is the purpose of the goal, what are you setting out to achieve? As the name suggests the answer to that question should be as specific as you can possibly be. For an example of the difference compare the following:

*I want to lose weight*  
*I want to lose 10 kilograms by my birthday*

The first goal is very open to interpretation, how much should you lose to hit your goal? How long do you have to complete it? Each question about a goal adds more uncertainty and goals with high uncertainty are rarely hit. So when you craft your next goal ensure to be specific in what you want to achieve, consider the how, when, why and where.

# Measurable
Measurability is all about knowing at what point you have hit your goal. If we refer back to the prior example we measured our weight loss by knowing when we have lost 10 kilograms our goal is complete. Every goal needs to have an endpoint otherwise you are setting yourself up to fail. When thinking about making measurable goals try to ensure the measuring method is something concrete. Happiness, for example, is not easy to measure and while you may feel happier using it as a metric to determine when a goal is hit is going to be extremely hard.

# Achievable
This can sometimes be called attainable but they both have the same purpose in goal setting. An achievable goal is not just something that is possible, it is something that is possible specifically for you and your situation. So if you are currently earning £20,000 and are setting a goal to earn more money within the next few years, aim for £30,000 or even £40,000. Don’t immediately jump up to £100,000+ if that isn’t currently realistic for you. If you set lots of small achievable goals then they will act as stepping goals that will get you to those big goals down the line.

# Relevant
Relevancy is all about reviewing the goal you are setting yourself and deciding if it really is something you want. You should always aim to keep your goals aligned with your interests, it helps you stay committed and engaged with them rather than forgetting about them. People may dream of running a successful business but is it realistic for you to work long hours, take onboard high levels of risk and potentially even more sleepless nights? 

# Time-Related
All good goals need an endpoint and yours should be no different. In line with being specific, you want your goals to be thoroughly time boxed. That way you can appraise yourself over time and keep yourself accountable on your progress as you get closer to your deadline. You can also use these timeframes to arrange your goals in ways in which they won’t collide so you don’t overload yourself. Ensure your timely goals are flexible and realistic with where you are at the time. The purpose of the deadlines is to hold yourself accountable not to create unneeded levels of stress.


# Going forwards
I am going to leave you with a few examples of my own SMART goals, some I’ve already completed and some I am currently working towards. Hopefully, they’ll help you review your own goals and determine whether or not you could add more details to them to make them SMART goals.

*Create a new 15 minute Lightning Talk for work by 31st May on VIM*  
*Create a list of Family / Friend birthdays and add them to my calendar by the end of April*  
*Create a blog post on ‘waking up earlier’ before the end of June*

They're all fairly self-explanatory but as an additional tip, I tend to add my goals to a [Trello](https://trello.com) board as tasks. Then in the description, I create subheadings for a letter of SMART and fill in a quick sentence about how this goal meets the criteria.
