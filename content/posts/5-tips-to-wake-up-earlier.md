Everyone has seen the videos about how every CEO wakes up at 5 am, how getting up earlier is the path to enlightenment and not to mention you will be a millionaire within the year. Regardless of what you have been sold, taking advantage of the morning where there are fewer distractions can be invaluable for productivity. So here are some tips on how I’ve managed to consistently wake up earlier feeling refreshed.
  

# Go to bed earlier
You knew this was coming before you even clicked on this post. If you want to get up earlier then you need to commit to going to bed at a reasonable time. I also do not mean getting in bed then watching your favourite shows for hours on end.You should be getting in bed with the sole purpose of sleeping. Personally, I work best on at least 7 hours sleep and I’d estimate most of you reading this are roughly the same. So work backwards from the time you want to get up and use that to decide when you should be *asleep* by. That means getting into bed a bit earlier than the time you land at so that you have time to drift off.

# Have a Night-time Routine
You should start your night right, having a routine at the end of the day to wind down and prepare yourself for bed can help massively with getting a good nights rest. Over time your body will begin to associate this routine with preparation for sleep and you will find yourself drifting off a lot easier. Personally, I like to read (I am currently working my way through [Drive](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1786891700/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1786891700&linkCode=as2&tag=mikeycodes-21&linkId=67e4b55ddceb31e6fe54681fda9de0ae)), wash my face and just generally keep myself away from the outside world. My body has gotten used to this routine and by the time I am usually finishing a chapter I cannot stop yawning and I will end up sleeping not long after. The key to a good routine is not copying someone else and experimenting to find what works for you.

# Forget about that alarm
This tip might be a little bit unusual or scary to some of you. I will preface this with if you have to be up at a certain time for work, set a backup alarm at the latest possible time that you could get up at. Hopefully, you will never hear that infuriating beeping again but you can have some peace of mind knowing you have a safety net if you do sleep in. Our body’s internal clock is a lot better than we give it credit and given the proper resources and training you can naturally wake up roughly any time you want. I am not going to promise that you will be jumping out of bed but you will feel a lot more refreshed. The trick to not having an alarm is taking on board the first tip - go to bed earlier. Your goal is to have your body naturally wake up on its own without an alarm. Although not all alarms are terrible if you do struggle with that, sunrise alarms gradually light up the room to break your sleep cycle and bring you around without any loud noise. They often come with a backup beep if you do not wake up from the light to boot. There are quite a lot of different types but you do not need to break the bank to pick one up. The sunrise alarm clock I have is roughly the same as this [one](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07CVKP2CD/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=B07CVKP2CD&linkCode=as2&tag=mikeycodes-21&linkId=fc91cc7688f7444b3407c6d220b3bb8d) and does the job fine.

# Have the  Proper Resources
You have probably heard it before but we sleep for roughly a third of our lives. Investing in your sleep will pay dividends back to you. So take a look at your sleeping arrangements and see if there is anything that could be improved; whether that be a new mattress, new sheets or anything else you can think of. When it comes to mattresses you are going to have to do a bit of research and see what suits you best, personally I find pocket spring mattresses work best for me and I avoid all types of memory foam because I just do not find it comfortable. You may be completely different so there is not much I can advise here but if you are watching the pennies, most stores will sell display models at a heavily discounted price.


# Have a reason to get up
This tip is almost as fundamental as going to bed earlier. I am going to assume if you want to get up earlier you have a reason to do so. If you are only doing it because you saw a youtube video saying it will turn you into a millionaire within a year then you are going to have a hard time. The key to getting out of bed earlier is wanting to do it, and having a goal to work towards will give you that ‘want’. Personally, I have gotten interested in Calisthenics so I get up earlier to do some drills before I get ready for work and the progression I am seeing from it keeps me motivated to continue getting up earlier than I used to. So find what your ‘want’ is and the night before plan on how you are going to tackle it in your mornings. Then when you wake up, reinforce it by committing to doing it.

# To conclude…
The important lesson to take from this post if anything is if you want to get up earlier you need to understand why you want to. Once you understand your ‘why’ then you can use that to drive yourself forwards and build the habit of leveraging your mornings for increased productivity. A lot of these ideas are what worked for me but everyone is different so take them and experiment to find what works for you.
