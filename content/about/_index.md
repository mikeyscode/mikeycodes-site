### About me.

I'm a Manchester based Software Engineer currently working at a WiFi Analytic's company. I'm big on goal setting, running and self improvement in general. Mention anything tech related to me and you'll see my eyes light up. Language wise I have quite a wide skill set but my current role is focused primarily in the PHP eco-system but I am trying to slip more Go related work into my daily workflows where I can.
