      <description>Your IDE Is Not an Excuse for Unreadable Code &amp;nbsp;
I was reviewing some pull requests recently and I got into a little debate. Just before I go into what that was exactly let me prefix this with: as a developer I am a very strong believer in writing clean, readable code. From top to bottom it should read like a story and if I handed it to someone who had never coded in their life, I want them to be able to understand roughly what the code is doing.</description>

      <description>Some Musings on Money I recently finished reading an interesting book; Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. Inside it there were some interesting views on the differences between the poor, middle class and the rich. The book was good at getting me thinking about my own situation, and the situation of those I care about. I would definitely recommend picking up the book and giving it a read if you have any sort of interest in personal finance.</description>

      <description>Introduction to Redis Pipelines What are Pipelines? At the very basic level Redis Pipelines allow us to send multiple commands to our server, have them executed and then read all the replies. If you are wondering why thatâ€™s different to how it normally works, think of it this way:
We have a bridge, on one side of the bridge is all the commands we want to run. Our helper memorises a single command, carries it across the bridge and executes it.</description>
