I still haven't really gotten around to writing anything interesting just yet but hopefully that'll change this year. New year, new me is still a thing right? My goal for now is to just try and at least write one post a month, but I wouldn't hold me to that, I'm easily distracted.

In terms of content you can expect it most likely won't be all technical. I'll probably throw up a few posts relating to other areas I find interesting such as; Finance, Self Defence, Goal setting and Running.

So that's all I've got to say for now, thanks for reading, hopefully i'll see you back here soon!

_P.s. If you're wondering about the "Pigeon Whispering" in the tag line, that's quite a simple one. For as long as I can remember I've been able to make a Pigeon-esque noise. It's probably my coping mechanism for the fact I can't whistle._
