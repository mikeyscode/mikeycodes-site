# Some Musings on Money

I recently finished reading an interesting book; Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki. Inside it there were some interesting views on the differences between the poor, middle class and the rich. The book was good at getting me thinking about my own situation, and the situation of those I care about. I would definitely recommend picking up the book and giving it a read if you have any sort of interest in personal finance. Below i’ve just rambled about some thoughts I've had after reading the book.

### We Shy Away from Talking about Money
This may be more focused on my own generation but from my personal experience i’ve found that many people shy away from talking about money. On more than one occasion I’ve been told I should stop talking about money, or that I talk about it too much. This to me is a bad approach to take, one of the ways we can learn is by talking with others, we can bounce ideas off one another, call out inaccuracies and help each other grow. We should encourage each other to talk more about our personal finances because as we do and we learn then we’ll potentially be able to improve our financial situation. 

Consider Compound Interest, I have spoke about this with a few of my friends (who are mostly in their early twenties) and they have generally switched off and dismissed it. Now i’m going to quickly say that everyone is in control of their own financial situation, and the decision of what to do with their money is entirely up to them… but we are still young, and that is something you do not get twice. We can use that youth to our advantage:

Take two people, Alice and Bob. Alice grew up talking about money and decided at age 18 when she got her first job she was going to start putting a bit of money aside for her future. Meanwhile Bob avoided money, he spent pretty much everything he found that special person he wanted to start a life with. At that point Bob, now 30, realised he had to start saving. 

Both of them started with £1000 in capital in their account and from their starting points put £200 into savings each month. Each year they gained 3% interest, so by age 50, how are they both fairing?

|                 | Alice       | Bob         |
|-----------------|:------------|:------------|
| Starting Age    | 18          | 30          |  
| Initial Capital | £1000       | £1000       |  
| Monthly Deposit | £200        | £200        |  
| Annual Interest | 3%          | 3%          |
| Savings at 30   | £36,037.62  | £1000       |
| Savings at 50   | £130,620.06 | £67,338.22  |
| Savings at 65   | £248,861.28 | £160,270.23 |

Quite a sizable difference, I know which situation I would rather be in. Being young is a powerful tool in itself, and we should use it to our advantage where we can. Talk about money, educate each other on it and reap the rewards. If you don't believe me, lets stack the odds in Bob's favour and give Alice a mere 1% interest rate for the duration of the 47 years she's saving -- she would still finish with `£145,473.45` which is almost as much as Bob who has just enjoyed his saving years with 3% interest.

### Financial Literacy Is Not Taught in Schools
I believe the book summed this up best with the following quote: 

_“One of the reasons the rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class struggles in debt is that the subject of money is taught at home, not in school.”_ 

When was the last time you picked up a book which improved your knowledge of personal finance? For a large majority of it I worry that the answer is never. We are in an information age, there is so much knowledge available at our fingertips that we could spend all day, every day learning and still never scratch the surface of what is available. Your education should not stop when you finished school, it should be a continual process throughout all of your life. 

But to go back to the main point, schools very rarely if at all cover financial topics in any level of detail. For me personally the only financial education I received was at the hand of my business studies lessons and even that was limited. I agree with the opinion of the book that schools are not doing enough to teach children about proper financial management while they’re young. 
We have to realise though as adults that just because you did not learn something at school, or you had a bad teacher - that is no excuse. Invest time into yourself, invest time into learning a new skill whether it be finance or otherwise and it will always be the one of the smartest investments you ever make.

&nbsp;

### I Can’t Afford It
I think this was one of my favourite points in this book, I have on many occasions when I wanted to purchase something, or go out with my friends said: “I can’t afford it” then just completely shut down and dismissed the idea. The book mentions how this is the wrong attitude, rather than saying that I can’t afford it I should be asking myself “How can I afford it?” because that question will lead to my growth and potentially coming up with a plan on how I can get what I want. The thought process that follows when you change your mindset is really interesting and when you achieve what you want the feeling you get is indescribable. 

I put this into play prior to actually reading the book without realising. I planned to change my car in 2018, and I really wanted some form of sports car. Now at age 24 they can be a little bit expensive for me so I set about and thought about how I could afford them. In the end I have cut back my costs, make a few investments and heavily saved money from my salary. As a result come May time I should be ready to purchase the car I want, and I can’t wait.

### Don’t be Afraid to Fail
This one is not directly linked to personal finance, but it is a topic that came up in the book and an important topic at that. The book states:

_“People who avoid failure also avoid success.”_

There is no truer quote to me, failure is a part of life and how we grow. You will never meet a successful person who has never failed - it just is not possible. Bring your minds back to when you were a baby, and join me for this cliché example: when you learnt to walk you fell a lot, you failed continually but you failed forwards. Each failure pushed you into the next attempt until eventually you were running around causing all types of havoc for your parents. We seem to forget that as we grow up, we try to avoid failure to save face or we play everything so safe that we see no real progression. That is no way to live in my opinion, we cannot be afraid to fail, we should instead want to fail because it means we have more to learn. We can use that failure to drive us forwards and come out the other side a better person.

&nbsp;

### To Conclude…
Try to talk about money, do not shy away from it. When we talk we learn, and that ability to learn is one of the greatest traits we have. Educate yourselves on anything and everything you can. Understand the importance about how the words you choose when talking to yourself will affect you and if you’re going to fail at something, let it be the driving force towards your next attempt and not the driving force as to why you give up.

We are still early into 2018, there's more than enough time left in this year to make a change for the better.
